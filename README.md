This projects make use of likelihood fitting to separate data of interest (signal) from data corresponding to background sources.
"fit_unbinnedlikelihood.ipynb" uses likelihood fitting to separate signal from background.
"Least_squares_fit_etaprime_omega.ipynb" does the same, but using Least Squares fit.
"fit_unbinnedlikelihood_2DQF.py" uses Q-factor technique to assign each entry of the data weights corresponding to signal and background.
